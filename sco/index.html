          <h3>Army Responsibility</h3>
          <hr>
          <ol class="description">
            <li><b><em>The primary responsibility of our Army is to conduct prompt and sustained land combat as part of 
              the joint force.</em></b> The Army must deliver ready, trained, and equipped forces to meet the demands placed 
              upon it. Our Nation expects the Army to be lethal, agile, and adaptive. In 1899, Secretary of War 
              Elihu Root wrote, &ldquo;The real object of having an army is to prepare for war.&rdquo; When not engaged in 
              direct conflict, the Army focuses its efforts on conducting operations to prepare for and deter war. 
              Our Army achieves readiness through sound doctrine, capable organizations, realistic training and 
              education, modernized equipment, inspired leadership, and disciplined Soldiers. Readiness is what 
              makes our Army credible.<br> 
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 1&ndash;1</li>
            <li><b><em>Our Army is interdependent with the other elements of the joint force and serves as the foundation upon which 
              the joint force conducts land operations.</em></b> Just as the Army requires joint capabilities to conduct operations, the 
              joint force also requires Army capabilities to succeed across the multiple domains of air, land, maritime, space, 
              and cyberspace. Army support to other Services provides key enabling capabilities to the joint force to include 
              operational&ndash;level command and control, communications, intelligence, and sustainment support. Only credible and 
              ready land forces operating as an element of the joint force provide U.S. decision makers with strategic options 
              to shape operational environments, prevent conflict, prevail during large&ndash;scale ground combat operations, and 
              consolidate gains to win in volatile or uncertain environments.<br>  
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 1&ndash;2</li>
            <li>Landpower enables the Nation&rsquo;s leaders to respond to security challenges in definitive and decisive ways. <b><em>Landpower 
              focuses on destroying an enemy&rsquo;s armed forces, occupying its territory, and breaking its will.</em></b> Landpower protects our 
              national interests, brings order to chaos, and protects populations. Only the Army has the capability and capacity to 
              seize, occupy, and control large land areas; provide civil security; and provide a visible and physical presence throughout 
              a territory or country. Controlling land requires a commitment of landpower, a commitment historically met by Army forces 
              and expressed by U.S. Navy Rear Admiral J. C. Wylie.<br>
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 1&ndash;3</li>
            <li>The Army&rsquo;s legacy of service makes clear the critical role of the American Soldier before, during, and after conflict. War will 
              continue to remain an intensely human endeavor. To defend our Nation&rsquo;s security and prosperity in the increasingly interconnected 
              and volatile world, the Army must remain globally engaged, provide America’s leaders with options, and defend the Nation&rsquo;s vital 
              interests on the ground. <b><em>This requires a well&ndash;trained and equipped Army prepared to protect the homeland, to defeat any enemy

            <h3>Roles of the Army Explained</h3>
            <hr>
            <h5>Shape Operational Environments</h5>
            <p>The Army provides unique forces with capabilities to shape operational environments. <b><em>Shaping operational environments 
              allows combatant commanders to reassure partners and deter aggression while establishing conditions that support the 
              potential employment of joint forces. </b>Army regionally aligned forces&mdash;including special operations units, <b>Army Reserve 
              units, and Army National Guard units&mdash;assist partners with internal defense and develop the capabilities needed to deter 
              adversaries and defeat enemies.</em> </b>Army forces further develop relationships with multinational partner land forces, share 
              intelligence, strengthen their security forces, increase cultural awareness, and conduct bilateral and multilateral 
              military exercises. Through efforts such as the State Partnership Program, Army National Guard and Reserve units supply 
              unique and dual&ndash;trained Soldiers with special skills obtained as civilians to assist in medical and engineering activities, 
              disaster preparedness, critical infrastructure management, and resource protection. Together, these efforts allow the Army 
              to maintain a global landpower network that is critical in shaping operational environments and winning wars. Army forces 
              conduct shaping operations through the day&ndash;to&ndash;day actions of its Service component commanders, trainers, advisors, and 
              logistic activities as specified under Title 10, USC and support to Title 22 and Title 50, USC.<br>  
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 2&ndash;19</p>
            <h5>Preventing Conflict</h5>
            <p><b><em>Preventing conflict includes all activities that deter adversary military actions which threaten allies or partners and 
              deny them the ability to achieve objectives counter to U.S. interests.</em></b> A well&ndash;trained, credible, and capable Army reduces 
              the risk of aggression by adversaries because it raises both the risk and potential cost of military action to their 
              forces. Moving ready and trained Army forces into a region tells adversaries that the United States is prepared and willing 
              to protect its interests. Partner nations under external threats understand that introducing U.S. forces alters the regional 
              military balance of power in their favor and bolsters their resolve to resist aggression. Multinational partners and 
              adversaries recognize that Army forces&mdash;combined with the nation&rsquo;s joint air, maritime, and space&ndash;based forces&mdash;are dominant 
              and therefore are a deterrence to armed conflict. This role meets the objectives described in the National Military Strategy.<br>
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 2&ndash;20</p>
            <h5>Prevail In Large-Scale Ground Combat</h5>
            <p>The Army&rsquo;s capability and capacity to conduct large&ndash;scale ground combat is unique and foundational to its other roles. 
              <b><em>Only the Army has the capabilities necessary for sustained ground combat anywhere in the world.</em></b> The credibility inherent 
              in its ability to conduct large&ndash;scale ground combat as part of the joint force is a critical part of U.S. conventional 
              deterrence. It is a primary source of assurance to friendly nations and an important factor in worldwide stability. The 
              U.S. Army conducts large&ndash;scale ground combat as part of the joint force. When it deploys and fights, the Army both enables 
              and is enabled by the other Services when they perform their roles. An Army that can defeat any enemy worldwide requires 
              professionally committed leadership, well&ndash;equipped and trained units, and proficiency in the conduct of joint and 
              multinational operations. Maintaining the readiness necessary for large&ndash;scale ground combat is a difficult and continual 
              process that consumes significant time and resources. Readiness for large&ndash;scale ground combat operations saves lives.<br>
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 2&ndash;21</p>
            <h5>Consolidated Gains</h5>
            <p>Operations to consolidate gains make temporary operational successes enduring and set the conditions to facilitate the 
              transition of control over territory to legitimate authorities. Army forces enable the joint force commander to capitalize 
              on operational success by following through to ensure sustainable conditions on the ground. <b><em>Consolidation of gains is an 
              integral part of winning armed conflict and is essential to retaining the long&ndash;term initiative over determined adversaries.</em></b> 
              Army forces reinforce and integrate the efforts of all unified action partners when they consolidate gains. Operations serve 
              a higher national purpose in support of U.S. interests and are planned and executed to support that purpose at each echelon. 
              A clear understanding of the higher purpose of the mission and operational environment determines what must happen to 
              consolidate gains during the course of operations. How well ground forces consolidate gains determines in large part how 
              enduring the results of operations will be. <b><em>Effectively consolidating gains increases options for national leaders and 
              contributes to decisive outcomes.</em></b><br>

            <h3>The Core Competencies Explained</h3>
            <hr>
            <h5>Prompt and Sustained Land Combat</h5>
            <p>Prompt and sustained land combat is the assigned function of the Army, directed both by Congress in Title 10, USC, and by 
              DODD 5100.01. This function is the foundation from which the Army builds its ability to win in combat. It is the primary 
              function for which the Army organizes, trains, and equips forces. <b>Prompt land combat</b> is what requires the Army’s 
              expeditionary capability: the ability to deploy on short notice task&mdash;organized forces capable of immediately conducting 
              operations upon arrival to austere locations. <b>Sustained land combat</b> requires the Army to campaign with the power to 
              conduct extended operations and continuous consolidation of gains necessary to achieve the objectives set for the Army 
              by the joint force. Sustained land combat spans the range of military operations. It requires a force that can sustain 
              its efforts for as long as necessary and can adapt to unpredictable changes in an operational environment.<br>
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 2&ndash;25</p>
            <h5>Combined Arms Operations</h5>
            <p>All operations are combined arms operations. <b><em>Combined arms is the synchronized and simultaneous application of arms to 
              achieve an effect greater than if each element was used separately or sequentially</em></b> (ADP 3&ndash;0). Combined arms includes Army 
              capabilities and joint, multinational, and other unified action partner capabilities. Combined arms operations integrate 
              leadership, information, and each of the warfighting functions. Used destructively, combined arms integrate different 
              capabilities so that responding to one capability makes the enemy vulnerable to another. Combined arms multiply the 
              effects of Army and joint capabilities in operations. They require highly trained Soldiers, skilled leaders, and 
              integrated information systems. Commanders synchronize combined arms capabilities using command and control to employ 
              combat power to their best advantage. Combined Arms Operations will be further discussed in S307.<br>
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 2&ndash;26</p>
            <h5>Special Operations</h5>
            <p>Special operations require unique modes of employment, tactics, equipment, and training. <b><em>Army special operations forces 
              provide combatant commanders with precise lethal and nonlethal capabilities.</em></b> These capabilities include special warfare and 
              surgical strike operations in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive areas. These operations may be time sensitive, 
              clandestine, low visibility, and high risk. Special operations forces possess uniquely assessed, organized, trained, and 
              equipped Soldiers. The interdependence of special operations and conventional forces, gained by the right mix of complementary 
              and reinforcing capabilities, enhances success throughout the range of military operations across the competition continuum.<br>
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 2&ndash;31</p>
            <h5>Set and Sustain the Theater for the Joint Force</h5>
            <p>The Army’s ability to set and sustain the theater is essential to allowing the joint force to seize the initiative while 
              restricting an enemy force’s options. <b><em>Setting the theater for the joint force includes the establishment of access and 
              infrastructure to support joint force operations.</em></b> The Army possesses unique capabilities to establish and maintain vital 
              infrastructure and support the joint force commander. These capabilities include intelligence support; communications; port and 
              airfield opening; logistics; ground-based air defense; chemical defense; and reception, staging, onward movement, and integration. 
              Sustaining the theater for the joint force includes theater sustainment and meeting executive agent responsibilities. Maintaining 
              critical infrastructure&mdash;as well as sustaining joint forces, unified action partners, and multinational forces&mdash;is accomplished 
              through the Army’s support to other Services, executive agent, and Title 10, USC, requirements. The Army uses Army Service 
              component commands, forward deployed forces, and rotational forces to develop, sustain, and operate this theater structure.<br>
              Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 2&ndash;32</p>
            <h5>Integrate National, Multinational, and Joint Power on Land</h5>
            <p>The Army has the largest number of headquarters that are joint task force headquarters capable and can combine all elements of 
              national, multinational, and joint power. <b><em>Army headquarters are designed to be the core components that integrate unified action 
              partner capabilities into a Service headquarters or rapidly transition from a Service headquarters into a joint or multinational 
              joint task force or land component command.</em></b> These headquarters provide the capability to plan, prepare, execute, and assess joint and 
              multinational operations. Army forces support partners with situational understanding, security, and logistics. Army forces ensure 
              combatant commanders possess the ability to reinforce and sustain land forces rapidly through forward positioning, theater 
              infrastructure capabilities, and the use of prepositioned equipment and supplies. Army headquarters and forces help impose order to 
              chaotic situations and synchronize plans, programs, and efforts necessary to accomplish the mission.<br>

          <h5>Possible Answer:</h5>
          <p>Ref: ADP&ndash;1, para 1&ndash;9</p>
          <p>The Army National Guard has a dual role based on the Constitution. <b><i>Its first role is that of a state military force. Its 
            second role is as an operational reserve for the Regular Army.</i></b> Each state, the U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the 
            Virgin Islands), and the District of Columbia have Army National Guard units totaling 54 state and territorial National 
            Guards. Army National Guard forces remain under the command of their respective governors until mobilized for federal 
            service. Each state or territory Army National Guard has an adjutant general&mdash;a general officer appointed by the governor&mdash;who 
            serves as its uniformed leader. <b><i>The governor can order the Army National Guard to state service since it is a state military 
            force.</i></b> The Army National Guard responds to natural disasters and other domestic emergencies many times each year. While serving 
            their states, these Soldiers are subject to civil laws and their states&lsquo; Codes of Military Justice. A governor can use the Army 
            National Guard of the state for law enforcement, which is something that federal military forces cannot perform except under 
            special circumstances. A small number of Army National Guard Soldiers are on full&ndash;time active duty, a duty status called &rdquo;Active 
            Guard and Reserve.&rdquo;</p>

              <h3>The State Partnership Program (SPP)</h3>
              <hr>
              <p><b>Vision:</b> National Guard State Partnership Program: expanding and strengthening U.S alliances and 
                partnerships around the world&mdash; partner focused, strategically aligned.</p>
              <p><b>Mission:</b> The SPP supports the security cooperation objectives of the United States and the Geographic 
                Combatant Commands (GCC) by developing enduring relationships with partner countries and carrying out activities to build 
                partner capacity, improve interoperability, and enhance U.S. access and influence while increasing the readiness of U.S. 
                and partner forces to meet emerging challenges.</p>
              <p><b>Overview:</b> The SPP is a DoD security cooperation program, managed and administered by the Chief 
                National Guard Bureau, executed by the GCCs, and sourced by the National Guard of the States and Territories. The SPP 
                supports the security cooperation objectives of the appropriate GCC and U.S. Chief of Mission.</p>
              <p><b>Codified in Law:</b> In Section 341 of Title 10, United States Code, Congress authorized the Secretary of 
                Defense to establish a program of activities &ldquo;to support the Security Cooperation objectives of the United States, 
                between members of the National Guard of a State or territory and any of the following: a) the military forces of a 
                foreign country, b) the security forces of a foreign country, c) governmental organizations of a foreign country whose 
                primary functions include disaster response or emergency response.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><b>Highlights:</b> The National Guard has forged enduring partnerships through the SPP for more than 25 years 
                while helping to build U.S. and partner capacity to meet 21st century security challenges. Beginning as a program designed 
                to assist countries emerging from behind the Iron Curtain, the SPP now involves one&ndash;third of the world&rsquo;s countries and the 
                National Guard of every U.S. state and territory. Most of the earliest SPP partner countries in Europe have gone on to 
                become U.S. allies in NATO, and many of them credit the SPP and their National Guard state partners with helping make that 
                possible:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The SPP has created 78 enduring, cost&ndash;effective partnerships. The most recent partnership from 2019 is Rwanda</li>
                    <li>The SPP is strategically important to our national defense. National Guard service members&rsquo; efforts make vital 
                      contributions to the Joint Force, executing our national defense strategy by advancing multinational understanding and 
                      support</li>
                    <li>15 SPP countries deployed forces alongside their U.S. National Guard partners in over 80 rotations to Iraq and/or Afghanistan</li>
                    <li>Army and Air Guard Soldiers and Airmen engage in more than 1,000 SPP events annually</li>
                    <li>At any one time, up to 48 SPP partner countries provide more than 35,000 personnel to all 14 active United Nations 
                      peacekeeping operations</li>
                    <li>The SPP helps position the U.S. to react effectively to anticipated or unanticipated global scenarios as they emerge</li>
                    <li>GCCs and U.S. Ambassadors strongly endorse the SPP for cultivating beneficial, long&ndash;term relationships</li>
                    <li>This cost&ndash;effective, small footprint program delivers a significant return on investment by broadening the pool of 
                      foreign security partners</li>
                </ol>
